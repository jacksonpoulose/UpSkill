🧠 UpSkill — Learn From Industry Professionals

Developed by:
👨‍💻 Jackson — Backend Developer (API, Database Design, Documentation)
👩‍💻 Fathima — Frontend Developer (UI/UX, Client-side Integration)

🚀 Project Overview

UpSkill is a learning and mentorship platform built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
Our goal is to help students and professionals enhance their software development skills through mentorship from experienced professionals working in reputed companies.

Unlike traditional online courses, UpSkill focuses on self-learning with guided mentorship. Mentors provide feedback, review tasks, and guide learners through structured learning programs.

🎯 Key Features

🧑‍🏫 Mentorship by Industry Experts – Learn directly from professionals with strong backgrounds and high-paying roles.

📚 20-Week Structured Learning Programs – Comprehensive, stack-based curriculum for various technologies.

🔍 Stack-Based Mentor Matching – Mentors are automatically assigned based on the student’s chosen technology stack.

💬 Task Review System – Mentors provide feedback on tasks and projects.

🧩 Self-Learning Approach – Students learn at their own pace with guidance from mentors.

🔐 Secure Authentication – JWT-based authentication for users and mentors.

⚙️ RESTful APIs – Robust backend supporting dynamic program and user management.

🧩 System Architecture
Frontend (React)  <-->  Backend (Express, Node.js)  <-->  Database (MongoDB)


Backend serves RESTful APIs for user authentication, mentor management, program assignment, and progress tracking.

Frontend consumes these APIs to deliver an interactive and seamless user experience.

🧠 Learning Program Model

Each program runs for 20 weeks, divided into weekly goals and assignments.
Students can:

Choose a technology stack (e.g., MERN, Python, Java, Data Science, etc.)

Get assigned to a relevant mentor

Complete weekly tasks and submit for mentor review
